As I have never worked with either hall effect sensors or magnetoresistive sensors before, and I don't know exactly how sensitive either one would be in these conditions or what kind of signal conditioning I will need, I need to set up an experiment. I am also, however, limited in my test equipment available, only a handheld DMM and whatever debugging tools are available to me on the microcontroller. Because of this, the arduino is a stronger contender than the MSP boards
